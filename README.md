## 📦 Installation

Since Node.js may not be in your PATH, you have two options:

### Option 1: Add Node.js to PATH (Recommended)

1. Find your Node.js installation (usually `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`)
2. Add it to your system PATH environment variable
3. Restart your terminal
4. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Use Full Path to Node/NPM

1. Find your Node.js installation directory
2. Run:
   ```bash
   "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" install
   "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" run dev
   ```

## 🎨 Design System

### Brand Colors (EXACT match from original FiltersFast)

- **Orange:** `#f26722` - Primary CTA buttons, accents
- **Blue:** `#054f97` - Secondary actions, navigation, headings
- **Blue (Links):** `#086db6` - Text links, hover states
- **Green (Success):** `#37b033` - Success messages, confirmations
- **Gray Scale:** Neutral backgrounds and text

**Note:** All colors have been audited against the original FiltersFast ASP site CSS to ensure perfect brand consistency.

### Component Library

Located in `/components`:

- **UI Components:** Button, Card (reusable primitives)
- **Layout:** Header, Footer (persistent across pages)
- **Home:** HeroSection, FilterTools, FeaturedCategories, etc.

### Tailwind Utilities

Common patterns defined in `globals.css`:

- `.btn-primary` - Orange CTA button
- `.btn-secondary` - Blue action button
- `.input-field` - Standardized form inputs
- `.card` - Product/content cards
