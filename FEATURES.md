5. Configure SEO settings
6. Set active status and display order
7. Save

#### Access Partner Pages

Partners are accessible at:
- `/partners/wine-to-water`
- `/partners/habitat-for-humanity`

Example implementation:
```typescript
// On partner page
sessionStorage.setItem('partnerDiscountCode', partner.discountCode);

// At checkout
const code = sessionStorage.getItem('partnerDiscountCode');
```

### Analytics & Tracking

Partner page views are tracked automatically:
