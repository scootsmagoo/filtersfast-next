- `ShippingInsurance` - Main insurance selector component (`components/checkout/ShippingInsurance.tsx`)
- Integrates seamlessly into checkout payment step
- Responsive design with dark mode support

**Type System:**
```typescript
// lib/types/insurance.ts
InsuranceCarrier = 'standard' | 'premium' | 'none'
InsuranceSelection { carrier, cost, coverageAmount }
InsuranceOption { carrier, name, description, calculateCost, minOrderValue }
```

**Calculation Functions:**
- `calculateStandardInsurance(subtotal)` - Tiered pricing logic
- `calculatePremiumInsurance(subtotal)` - Percentage-based pricing (0.35%)

- `validateInsurance(carrier, orderSubtotal)` - Validation with helpful messages
- `formatInsuranceSelection(selection)` - Display formatting

**API Integration:**

- Metadata includes carrier type and coverage amount
- Description shows coverage type and maximum coverage
- Proper amount formatting for Stripe (cents)

**Checkout Flow Integration:**
1. Customer proceeds to payment step
2. Insurance component appears before donation section (if order ≥ $50)
3. Recommended option highlighted based on order value
4. Selection updates order total in real-time
5. Insurance appears on review step with edit option
6. Insurance included in order summary sidebar
7. Insurance passed to Stripe as separate line item

### Business Logic

**Display Rules:**
- Show insurance only for orders ≥ $50
- Recommend Standard for $50-$199 orders
- Recommend Premium for $200+ orders
- Default to "No Insurance" (customer opt-in)

**Validation Rules:**
- Standard requires $50+ order
- Premium requires $100+ order
- Invalid selections show helpful error message

**Pricing Transparency:**
- Insurance cost shown clearly next to each option
- Total insurance cost in order summary
- Detailed description in Stripe line item

### Data Tracking

- Coverage amount preserved for claims
- Integration ready for future analytics dashboard

### Business Impact

- **Revenue Stream** - Additional revenue from insurance fees
- **Customer Satisfaction** - Faster resolution of shipping issues
- **Competitive Advantage** - Professional service matching major retailers

### Legacy Migration Notes
- Based on `_INCinsurancecheck_.asp` and `INCMod.asp`
- Preserved legacy pricing tiers (USPS model for Standard)

```

**Cron Job Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
# Update rates daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/app && npm run update:currency-rates
```

#### 11. User Experience

**Currency Selection Flow:**
1. User visits site
2. System detects location (Cloudflare)
3. Currency auto-selected based on country
4. User can manually change via selector
5. Preference saved for future visits
6. All prices update instantly

**Transparency:**
- Currency code shown next to prices (when not USD)
- Disclaimer: "Charged in USD using current exchange rates"
- Exchange rate displayed at checkout
- Both currencies shown on order confirmation

#### 12. Performance Considerations

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Rates cached in memory on client
- LocalStorage for currency preference
- Hourly refresh (not on every page load)
- Single API call per session
- Efficient React context usage
- Memoized conversion functions

**Load Time Impact:**
- Initial load: +~50ms (rate fetch)
- Currency change: Instant (client-side)
- No blocking operations
- Graceful fallback to USD

#### 13. Testing & Validation

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Currency selector displays all options
- [ ] Prices convert correctly for each currency
- [ ] Currency preference persists across sessions
- [ ] Auto-detection works for different locations
- [ ] Cart totals update when currency changes
- [ ] Checkout shows correct converted prices
- [ ] Orders store currency and exchange rate
- [ ] Admin can manually update rates
- [ ] Rate updates reflect immediately
- [ ] Fallback to USD if rates fail

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Canadian User:** Should see CAD by default, prices in CA$
2. **European User:** Should see EUR, prices with € symbol
3. **Currency Switch:** Change USD → GBP, verify all prices update
4. **Cart Persistence:** Add items, change currency, refresh page
5. **Checkout:** Complete order in non-USD currency
6. **Rate Update:** Trigger manual update, verify new rates

#### 14. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**Rates Not Updating:**
```bash
# Verify API connection
npm run update:currency-rates

# Check logs for errors
# Verify OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_APP_ID if using custom key
```

**Currency Not Persisting:**
- Check browser localStorage
- Verify CurrencyProvider in layout
- Check for conflicting currency logic

**Prices Not Converting:**

### 7. Translation Usage in Components

**Client-Side (React Components):**
```tsx
import { useTranslation } from '@/lib/language-context';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { t, language } = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('nav.home', 'Home')}</h1>
      <button>{t('action.add_to_cart', 'Add to Cart')}</button>
      <p>Current language: {language}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Server-Side (API Routes, Server Components):**
```typescript
import { translate } from '@/lib/i18n-utils';
import { getTranslationsMap } from '@/lib/db/i18n';

// Single translation
const text = await translate('nav.home', 'es', 'Home');

// Multiple translations
const translations = getTranslationsMap('es');
const homeText = translations['nav.home'] || 'Home';
```

**Utility Functions:**
```typescript
import { 
  formatNumber, 
  formatCurrency, 
  formatDate, 
  interpolate,
  pluralize 
} from '@/lib/i18n-utils';

// Format number: 1234.56 -> "1,234.56" (en) or "1 234,56" (fr)
formatNumber(1234.56, 'fr');

// Format currency: 99.99 -> "$99.99" (en) or "99,99 $" (fr-ca)
formatCurrency(99.99, 'USD', 'fr-ca');

// Format date: 2025-11-03 -> "November 3, 2025" (en) or "3 novembre 2025" (fr)
formatDate(new Date(), 'fr');

// Interpolate variables: "Hello {name}!" -> "Hello John!"
interpolate("Hello {name}!", { name: "John" });

// Pluralize: (2, "item", "items") -> "items"
pluralize(2, "item", "items", 'en');
```

- Lazy loading of language-specific content
- Minimal initial payload

**API Performance:**
- Batch translation fetching
- Single database query for all translations
- Response caching with Next.js `cache: 'force-cache'`

**Middleware:**
- Lightweight language detection
- Cookie-based caching (no DB lookup)
- Only runs on first visit or language change

### 12. User Experience Flow

**First Visit:**
1. Middleware detects browser language from Accept-Language header
2. Sets language cookie (1-year expiration)
3. LanguageProvider loads translations for detected language
4. User sees site in their preferred language

**Language Change:**
1. User clicks language selector in header
2. Dropdown shows 4 language options with flags
3. User selects new language
4. API call to `/api/i18n/set-language`
5. Cookie updated (client + server)
6. Database preference updated (if logged in)
7. LanguageContext reloads translations
8. UI updates immediately without page reload

**Returning Visit:**
1. Cookie read by middleware
2. Language applied automatically
3. Instant language display (no flash)

### 13. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Language Selector:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys, Escape)
- ✅ ARIA labels (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`)
- ✅ ARIA roles (`role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`)
- ✅ Visual focus indicators (ring-2 ring-brand-orange)
- ✅ Screen reader announcements
- ✅ Color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ Touch target size (48x48px minimum)

- Translation values HTML-escaped in output
- SQL injection prevented (prepared statements)

**Access Control:**
- Admin endpoints protected with `isAdmin()` check
- Rate limiting on language change API (30 req/10 min)
- Audit logging for all translation changes

**XSS Prevention:**
- All translation output HTML-escaped
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for translations
- Content Security Policy enforced

**CSRF Protection:**
- POST requests use CSRF tokens (Better Auth)

- Origin verification

**Audit Logging:**
```typescript
// Every translation change logged
{
  user_id: string,
  action: 'update_translation' | 'delete_translation' | 'generate_translations',
  resource_type: 'translation',
  resource_id: string,
  details: string,
  ip_address: string,
  user_agent: string,
  timestamp: string
}
```

### 15. Database Initialization

**Script:** `npm run init:i18n`

**What it does:**
1. Creates 5 database tables:
   - `languages` - Supported languages
   - `translations` - UI text translations
   - `product_translations` - Product content
   - `category_translations` - Category names
   - `content_translations` - Pages, articles, support
2. Creates indexes for fast lookups
3. Inserts 4 languages (EN, ES, FR, FR-CA)
4. Inserts 90+ base English translations

**Run once during setup:**
```bash
npm run init:i18n
```

**Safe to run multiple times:**
- Uses `INSERT OR REPLACE` for idempotency
- Won't delete existing translations
- Updates metadata timestamps

### 16. Testing

**Manual Testing:**

6. Access admin panel, verify translation management works
7. Generate AI translations, verify they're accurate
8. Export translations, verify JSON format
9. Test keyboard navigation
10. Test mobile responsiveness
